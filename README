These are some Common Lisp snippets for xptemplate.

Screenshot of various snippets with placeholders activated (before most
of the placeholders have been filled in):

Of course, as usual, you can use your own colors and colorscheme.

NOTE:

  As of version 1.10, LispXp requires the newest version of xptemplate
  from SVN or git.

Known issues:

  Due to the limitations of the current version of xptemplate, I've had to use
  the name "dostar" instead of "do*", "letstar" instead of "let*", etc.  Also,
  the indentation of certain complex snippets like "defstruct" is not correct.

NOTE:

  I'm new to Lisp, and new to xptemplate, so don't expect the most
  sophisticated snippets, a religious adherence to the Hyperspec, or even a
  full set of snippets for every function and macro documented in the
  Hyperspec.

  These snippets are really mostly just for my own use, but if someone else
  finds them useful, then that's great.

As of version 1.10, these are the snippets that are included:
